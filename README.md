# Automatic-Question-Generation-T5-BERT-BART-Research-Paper

Generative AI has made much progress in the field of natural language processing, especially in sub-fields like machine translation, text summarization, and others. This study will focus in on the use of generative AI in question generation in particular. This slightly differs from the more common use of generative AI for answer generation in response to a question. For the sake of this study, we will be looking into the use of models for boolean question generation, multiple-choice question generation, and especially comprehension question generation. The models we intend on using are BERT, BART, and the small and base variants of the T5 transformer model. Depending on the task, the models are trained on the SQuAD, RACE, or BoolQ. The final models will be evaluated using the metrics: BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE 1, ROUGE 2, and ROUGE L. These will help in the comparative analysis of models, helping us highlight which models to use for different kinds of question generation.
